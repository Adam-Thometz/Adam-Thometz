# Hi, I'm Adam üëã  

## About Me 

I am a software engineer specializing in frontend development based in New York City (originally from Brooklyn, now in the Bronx). I love building beautiful and functional web applications and letting my creativity shine through code. I'm also passionate about uplifting other developers and sharing my knowledge.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy...  
üé∂ *music production*  
ü•ò *cooking*  
ü™¥ *gardening*  
ü•ã *martial arts*  
üéÆ *video games*  

I also have two pets, üêà Milo and ü¶é Unity. [I made an app whose sole purpose is to tell me what to feed Unity](https://github.com/Adam-Thometz/Reptifeed)
