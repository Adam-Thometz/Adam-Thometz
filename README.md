# Hi, I'm Adam 👋

## About Me 

I am a software engineer specializing in frontend development based in New York City. I love building beautiful and functional web applications and learning more about frontend technology.

As a former music and special education teacher, I care about and work toward accessibility and ease of use in my applications, as well as creative and divergent approaches to solving problems. I'm also passionte about uplifting other developers and sharing my knowledge, despite only being a junior. 😅  

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy music production, cooking, maintaining my indoor garden, and kung fu. I also have two pets, a tabby cat Milo, and a blue tongue skink Unity. [I made an app that just tells me what to feed Unity](https://github.com/Adam-Thometz/Reptifeed) (the README has pictures of her!)
