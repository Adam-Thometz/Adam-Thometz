# Hi, I'm Adam üëã  

## About Me 

I am a full-stack developer based in New York City (originally from Brooklyn, now in the Bronx). Some of my technical experience includes the following:
- integrating generative AI into existing products using Python
- implementing pixel-perfect designs from Figma using React, Next.js, and Tailwind
- playing music in the browser according to user input using Tone.js and Web Audio API
- creating software prototypes in Vue
- creating static and dynamic animations using CSS and Javascript
- creating custom APIs using Node/Express
- writing unit, integration, and UI tests using Jest and React Testing Library

My favorite coding pastime is building custom visualizations for music. [Here's my first one](https://www.adamthometz.com/acceptance-cave) and [here's my latest](https://www.adamthometz.com/passing), both of which use original music. It's an art I'm working to perfect.  

Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy...  
üé∂ *music production*  
ü•ò *cooking*  
üìñ *reading novels*  
ü•ã *kung fu*  

I also have two pets, üêà Milo and ü¶é Unity. [I made a full stack app whose sole purpose is to tell me what to feed Unity](https://github.com/Adam-Thometz/Reptifeed)
